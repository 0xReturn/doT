Created in search of the fastest and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs.

  doT.js is based on templating function extracted from excellent jQuery plugin jQote2 with some modifications.
  doU.js is based on templating function extracted from underscore.js with some optimizations.

Both doT.js and doU.js can be used with node or without and provide better performance than compiled undescore.js.

doT.js (using jQote2 technique) provides excellent performance under V8.


Benchmarks:
  jslitmus is used for benchmarking.
  Only execution of compiled templates is being measured, not generation of the templating functions.

To run the benchmarks:

  In the browser:
    http://olado.github.com/doT/templatesBench.html


  With node:
    node benchmarks/templatesBench.js
