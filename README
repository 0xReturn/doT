Created in search of the fast and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs.

  doT.js is based on templating function extracted from excellent jQuery plugin jQote2 with some modifications.
  doU.js is based on templating function extracted from underscore.js with some optimizations.

Both doT.js and doU.js can be used with node or without.

doT.js (using jQote2 technique) provides excellent performance under V8.


Benchmarks:
  jslitmus is used for benchmarking.
  Only execution of compiled templates is being measured, not generation of the template functions.

To run the benchmarks:

  In the browser:
    navigate to benchmarks/index.html
	or go to http://olado.github.com/doT/bench.html


  With node:
    node benchmarks/templatesBench.js
