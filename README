Created in search of the fast and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs.

	doT.js is based on templating function extracted from excellent jQuery plugin jQote2 with some modifications.
	doT.js can be used with nodejs, allows for custom template delimiters and only allows direct invocation of the compiled function.


	doU.js is based on templating function extracted from underscore.js with some optimizations.
	The main difference with underscore.js templating is that doU.js does not use performance impacting "with" statement.

	Both doT.js and doU.js can be used with node or without.

	doT.js (using jQote2 technique) provides excellent performance under V8.
	Addditional advantage of doT is that it allows you to flush data to the stream at any points in the generated template function, this is handy when using on server.


Benchmarks:
	jslitmus is used for benchmarking.
	Only execution of compiled templates is being measured, not generation of the template functions.

To run the benchmarks:

	In the browser:
		navigate to benchmarks/index.html
		or go to http://olado.github.com/doT/bench.html


	With node:
		node benchmarks/templatesBench.js

Install doT:
	npm install dot

	// use require('dot') in your code if you installed with npm

Usage:
	Both doU.js and doT.js by default use {{= }} and {{ }} delimiters, though other delimiters may be configured.
	doT.js also inherits jQote2' support for auto-encoding when ! is used.

	Both doU.js and doT.js have the same usage pattern.

	// 1. Compile template function
	var tempFn = doT.template("<h1>Here is a sample template {{=it.foo}} </h1>");
	// 2. Use template function as many times as you like
	var resultText = tempFn({foo: 'with doT'});
