Created in search of the fastest and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs. It shows great performance for both nodejs and browsers.

	doT.js is a blend of jQote2 and underscore.js templating functions with lots of additions and performance improvements. It is fast, small and has no dependencies.

Features:
		custom delimiters,
		runtime evaluation,
		runtime interpolation,
		compile-time evaluation,
		partials support,
		encoding,
		control whitespace - strip or preserve,
		streaming friendly

Benchmarks:
	jslitmus is used for benchmarking.

To run the benchmarks for measuring execution of compiled templates:

	In the browser:
		navigate to benchmarks/index.html
		or go to http://olado.github.com/doT/bench.html

	With node:
		node benchmarks/templatesBench.js

	doT.js vs other engines:
		http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating

To run the benchmarks for measuring compilation speed:

	In the browser:
		navigate to benchmarks/genspeed.html

	With node:
		node benchmarks/compileBench.js

Note about doU.js:
	doU.js is here only so that legacy extrenal tests do not break. Use doT.js.
	doT.js with doT.templateSettings.append=false provides the same performance as doU.js.
